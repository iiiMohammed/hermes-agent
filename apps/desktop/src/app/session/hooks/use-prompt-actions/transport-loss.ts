 * return). When the WS transport invalidates mid-request the channel rejects
 * EVERY pending call with the socket-death error (`json-rpc-channel.ts`
 * detach → dropSocket), so the submit pipeline used to settle the LIVE turn
 * with a definitive error card while the backend happily kept running it.
 *
 * Only errors that prove the RPC was in flight when the transport died are
 * transport losses. The pre-send refusal 'Hermes gateway is not connected'
 * (GATEWAY_NOT_CONNECTED_MESSAGE) fires BEFORE anything reaches the backend —
 * no turn exists server-side, so it must NOT gate on this path.

 * Routing caveat: `session.active_list` has no session_id param, so the probe
 * rides the ambient (active gateway) dispatcher. For a foreground session
 * that is the owning backend and an answered list without the row is

 * gateway never lists must NOT be read as settled — fail toward the live-ish
